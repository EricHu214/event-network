# Assignment 3
### Web Application Features
*Search* - Our application has a search function to allow users to discover new events. It has several filters (e.g. by city or start date) to assist users in narrowing down their search to only events that they're interested in.

*Event Details* - Users can click on each event card brought up by the search to get additional information about each event.

*User Accounts* -
Our web app allows users to create an account by registering their information. The login system requires a username and password. Passport allows a variety of different users to login and manage their own data.

*Interested Events* - People can make an account to save events that they're interested in. These events will be noted on your user profile, which is also visible to other users. Account holders can add or delete events from their list at will. Each event also features a list of users who have declared their interest.

### End Users - Roles and Use
The end user may use our app as a platform to discover new events to go to, as well as see what events other people are going to. They can save events in a list for future consideration or thought. Although we do not support direct purchase of event tickets on our app, all events feature a purchase link to the official Ticketmaster website should the user choose to buy.

### RESTful API
*Query* - Users can query for new events

*Add* - Users can add new events to their interested events lists

*Delete* - Users can delete events from their interested events lists

*Update* - Modify the users in the collection by updating their list of events
