*Search* - Our application has a search function to allow users to discover new events. It has several filters (e.g. by title, city, start date, or type) to assist users in narrowing down their search to only events that they're interested in.

*Event Details* - Users can click on each event card brought up by the search to get additional information about each event. They can get to know the place, time, and price of an event. They can also see a list of users who are interested in the event.

*User Accounts* - Our web app allows users to create an account by registering their information. The login system requires a username and password. Passport allows a variety of different users to login and manage their own data.

*Interested Events* - Users can make an account to save events that they're interested in. These events will be noted on your user profile, which is also visible to other users. Account holders can add or delete events from their list at will. Each event also features a list of users who have declared their interest.
